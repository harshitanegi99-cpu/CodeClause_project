### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

To create a **functional and user-friendly currency converter** application that accepts an amount, a source currency, and a target currency from the user, and calculates the correct conversion amount.

### âœ¨ Key Features

* **User Input Handling:** Safely accepts numeric amount input and text currency codes from the user.
* **Conversion Logic:** Implements the core mathematical logic for currency exchange.
* **Clear Output:** Displays the converted amount formatted to two decimal places.
* **Simple Command-Line Interface:** Easy to run and test directly from the terminal.

### ðŸš€ How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these simple steps to test the converter on your machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Paste the URL of your GitHub repository here]
    cd CodeClause_project
    ```
2.  **Run the Python Script:**
    ```bash
    python converter.py
    ```
3.  **Follow the Prompts:** The application will prompt you to enter the amount, the starting currency, and the target currency.

### ðŸ§  What I Learned

This project was a great foundation for essential programming concepts:

* **Handling User Input:** Mastering the `input()` function and basic Python type casting (converting string input to `float`).
* **Basic Flow Control:** Using `if/else` statements for decision-making in the conversion logic.
* **String Formatting:** Using f-strings to create a clear and readable final output for the user.
